# Aquagariman

![Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-green)

__Aquagariman__ is an educational game where the player controls an underwater character tasked with cleaning the ocean. The goal is to collect as much trash as possible, reducing water pollution and protecting marine life, either within a time limit or by completely clearing the game area.

## Goal
The main objective of the game is to reduce the pollution score to zero in each level by collecting different types of underwater trash that vary in environmental degradation and impact. The player must manage their time and oxygen to achieve this goal and progress to the next level.

## Rules
